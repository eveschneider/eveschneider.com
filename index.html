<p>As a parent of an 8th grader and a freshman in Geneva, I am passionate about public education.  I began my education career in 1989 as a Spanish Teacher in public schools.  In 1994 I was certified as a school counselor and have worked in this capacity since that time, again, in public schools.</p>

<p>I have had the fortunate experience of seeing students in a classroom setting as well as guiding them towards their future goals.  I have witnessed all the pitfalls, crises, trials and tribulations that students go through in adolescence.  For the past 10 years, I have also served as building leader where I work.   In this role, I serve as a liaison between building administration and teachers.  I also attend meetings with our district personnel.</p>

<p>My experience in education and by being involved in our school’s association, gives me a unique perspective on providing leadership, as well as complex decision-making.  I come to you as a non-partisan leader who likes to bring the right people to the table in order to make the best decisions possible for students.  I will facilitate decisive action for improvements. While future school funding remains uncertain, I will do the utmost to maintain a quality education for all students, high achieving and special needs, alike. While I would endeavor to improve graduation rates and test scores even more in Geneva, I do not want enrichment programs to fall by the wayside. I believe the Board’s job is to foster an educational environment where students thrive, not merely produce adequate test scores. My goals include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quality of education; to create an environment where every child has the opportunity to succeed</li>
<li>Equity of education for all students; technology awareness and resources for each student</li>
<li>Active support for our teachers; keeping class sizes at a reasonable size, rich curriculum, diverse electives, professional development</li>
<li>Accountability/transparency of administration at all levels</li> 
<li>District fiscal responsibility</li>
<li>Continued support of parent participation in their child’s education</li>
</ol>

<p>My experience has provided me with the knowledge, training and commitment necessary to lead Geneva during this critical period. I will continue to respect, value and encourage the involvement and contribution of Geneva’s parents, students and community.</p> 

<p>For dedicated, passionate and experienced, leadership I ask you to vote for me.  If elected, I will work hard, focus on pro-active change, and exercise leadership to foster consensus between teachers, administrators, parents, students, and the community at large.</p>
